This is a Node program for extracting your Rhapsody playlists from
http://www.rhapsody.com and writing them, in JSON format, to a local
file. You might use this information to help you re-create the
playlists at another subscription music site, for example.

To run it, you need to know your Rhapsody Id, which is a short string
of numbers and letters (mine is two letters followed by two numbers)
that you can find by visiting the Rhapsody website.  Point your
browser to http://www.rhapsody.com, log in, and go to "My Music ->
Profile". In the browser's address bar, you should see a URL like this:

    http://www.rhapsody.com/members/xxxx

The part of the URL marked xxxx above is your Rhapsody Id. 

While you are on your profile page, click on "Edit profile" and ensure
that "Share profile" is checked. If your profile is shared, then
anyone who knows your id can view the contents of your Rhapsody
library and playlists.  That's what this program does.  (You can turn
sharing off after running this program to extract your playlists)

Once you know your id and have checked that profile sharing is on, run
this program with a command like this:

     node RhapsodyPlaylistExporter xxxx

Where xxxx is your Rhapsody id.  The program will print a lot of
messages while it is requesting files from the Rhapsody website, and
eventually will create a file named 'playlists.json'. It is a plain
text file that describes your playlists, listing the artist, album,
and track name for each track of each playlist.
